# Team Website Generator

## Description

This application is designed to help you create a team website, with cards for each of the employees that compose a team. The application utilizes node to first provide instruction to the user on how to use the application, and then prompts the user to enter in the information for the teams manager. After manager information is inputed, the user can then input information for the engineers and interns that compose the team. You can enter in as many engineers and interns that you want, and once you are finished inputing information all you have to do is select generate webpage and it will be generated in the dist folder.

## How to use the Node/Javascript Application

Steps to use the application
* Step One: Clone the repository to your computer.
* Step Two: Utilizing the commandline make sure you run the code "npm install" as this project does utilize both inquirer and jest.
* Step Three: If all the previous steps have been conducted you can run "node app" in the command line and the application will then run. You can also run "npm run test" to run a test on all the object classes to ensure everything is working appropriately.
* Step Four: The Code will give you some instruction, but ultimately, all you need to do from this point is answer the prompts (all prompts are required so you cannot leave a question blank, and yes, there is error handling to insure that you answer each question).
* Step Five: You will come to a section prompting you between three options, if you no longer wish to add more engineers or interns, select the generate website option to generate your team website.
* Step Six: The index.html file for your website should be generated now and in the dist folder.
